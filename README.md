# Database Management Project 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and managing a relational database, including data creation, retrieval, optimization, and security implementation. The project required writing SQL queries to create, modify, and query a database, ensuring efficient performance and secure access control.

## Key Features
- **Database Design & Creation** – Developed tables with **primary and foreign keys**.
- **SQL Queries** – Implemented **SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE** commands.
- **Performance Optimization** – Created **indexes & views** for efficient data retrieval.
- **Database Security** – Used **GRANT & REVOKE** for access control.

## Database Schema
- The database consists of multiple tables

## SQL Implementations
### **Database Creation & Schema Setup**
- Designed and implemented relational tables with appropriate **primary and foreign keys** to maintain data integrity.

### **Data Queries & Manipulation**
- Executed queries for **data retrieval, insertion, updates, and deletions**, ensuring efficient database operations.

### **Indexing & Performance Optimization**
- Applied **indexing techniques** to optimize query performance and reduce search time.

### **User Access Control & Security**
- Implemented **role-based access control (RBAC)** using `GRANT` and `REVOKE` to manage database permissions securely.

## Skills Gained
- **SQL Database Design**
- **Data Retrieval & Manipulation**
- **Indexing & Query Optimization**
- **Access Control & Security Implementation**

## Additional Details
This project was completed as part of a university assignment. The full SQL scripts cannot be shared publicly due to academic integrity policies and copyright policies.
